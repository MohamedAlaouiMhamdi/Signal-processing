# Signal-processing
This project is focused on signal filtering using MATLAB. 
The project includes various techniques for filtering signals,
such as low-pass, high-pass, and band-pass filters. 
The project is particularly useful for those interested in applications such as audio processing, 
where signal filtering is a critical step in improving signal quality and removing noise.
The project contains several components that work together to filter signals. These include:
Filter Design: A module for designing different types of filters using MATLAB's built-in functions, 
such as the FIR and IIR filter design functions.
Filter Implementation: A module for implementing the designed filters on input signals using MATLAB's filter function.
Filter Analysis: A module for analyzing the filtered output signals,
including visualizing the filtered signal using MATLAB's plotting functions .
The project also includes several sample input signals, such as audio , to demonstrate the effectiveness of the filtering techniques. 
Additionally, the project provides detailed documentation on how to use the different modules and customize them for different filtering applications.
Overall, this project provides a valuable learning experience for anyone interested in signal processing and filtering, 
and can be easily adapted for use in other filtering applications.
